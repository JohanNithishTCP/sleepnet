        content: "The iQ2 changed my perception of my Sleep Apnea. Previously, I used a full face CPAP mask that was cumbersome, intrusive, noisy, and made me feel as though I had a severe medical condition. My mouth was covered and my ability to move comfortably was restricted. The iQ2 provides an entirely different experience. It fits comfortably and minimally over the nose for easy breathing while allowing for a quiet and restful night of sleep. Both my wife and I are happier with me sleeping with the iQ2."
